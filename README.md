### Release channels

JetBrains Marketplace has multiple channels for each plugin. Default is always the `Stable` channel,
however, Cake for Rider might make use of two other channels:

- **Beta**: The `beta` channel contains pre-releases.
- **Alpha**: The `alpha` channel contains unstable releases. Here be dragons!

To use one of the channels open the [plugin page in the JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15729-cake-rider/)
select *Versions* and switch the channel on the left side of the page. Download the desired version and install it manually.
